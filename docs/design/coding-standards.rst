Coding standards
================

Basic stuff
-----------

First solve bugs then add features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bug fixes are more important then new features.

Code Reviews
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every story is created in it's own branch. Person developing code then adds
pull request. This pull request must be accepted by someone else.

When asigning someone with a code-review, please mark your story as
``In Review`` and assign it to this person in JIRA.

Meaningfull commit messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use meaningfull commit messages. Please reference JIRA issue if appropriate.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For now code is fairly undocumented, which is bad.

Every class, and public function needs a proper docstring. These docstrings
are in sphinx format. We'll use `autodoc <http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html>`_
to extract documentation from docstrings.

Unittests
^^^^^^^^^

Aim for 100% unittest coverage (for changed code).

Time logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please log time spent on developing this application. I need this information
for political reasons (people at HQ don't have idea how much value we bring
in terms of free (as in beer) software).

Django stuff
------------

* Prefer `class based views <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/class-based-views/>`_ to function ones.
 * Even better: use `class based generic views <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/>`_.
* Try to keep inter application dependencies to minimum
* Separate scout code with generic code

Named urls
----------

All urls should be named and referenced only by its name and application
namespace. 

There is no clearly defined convention for naming urls in Django. Even across 
documentation there are different standards. In Drigan, we have determined
some simple url-naming rules:

* Try to keep the url name short and simple
* Always use hyphen (-) to separate words
* Use this set of words in a correct place to describe actions:
  * sufixes:
    * list (*not* index)
    * detail
  * prefixes:
    * create
    * update
    * delete

Furthermore, *always* specify application namespace in urls configuration 
and *always* use this namespace to reverse urls, eg.:

.. code-block:: python

    url(r"^pattern/", include('my_super_app.urls', app_name='my_super_app'))

And then when you reverse urls from this app:

.. code-block:: python

    reverse("my_supper_app:view-name")
